	    The AG1 Series is designed specifically for agricultural applications related to poultry, swine, turkey, equine and other controlled animal envirorunents. The Re-Verber-Ray AG1 Series is a complete product line of single stage, tube-type infra-red heaters that will offer standard control of a typical heated space in an agricultural operation.

              <h5>Re-Verber-Ray Infra-Red Heating Systems Designed For Agricultural Applications = Enhanced Overall Animal Performance + Energy Savings Up To 35%</h5>
              <br>
              <p>Re-Verber-Ray AG1 Series single stage tube-type infra-red heaters offer standard control of a typical heated space in an agricultural operation related to poultry, swine, turkey, equine and other controlled animal environments.</p>
	      <h5>Overall Design Criteria:</h5>
              <p>For all agricultural applications we recommend that a qualified person (such as an agricultural engineer or factory trained design specialist) complete a detailed environmental analysis to ensure proper heater selection and overall system compatibility. Re-Verber-Ray infra-red heating systems are an excellent method of optimizing the animals environmental needs.</p>
	      <p>Heater layouts for both new construction, and retrofit, typically include a warm zone, transitioning to a cool zone, thus allowing each animal to find their optimum comfort zone. Heater layouts are custom-tailored to your specific situation and take into consideration: total building heatloss; ventilation heatloss; overall radiant coverage; heat gain from the animals themselves; ventilation inlet location; orientation of the actual heaters and; unique design restrictions in a particular installation that may include clearance to combustibles, feed lines, air inlets and mounting height of the heaters. </p>
	      <h5>The Single Stage Re-Verber-Ray AG1 Series </h5>
	      <p>The single stage AG1 Series is a fixed input infra-red heater that is either on or off. In the agricultural marketplace across Canada Re-Verber-Ray fixed input infra-red heating systems are tried and proven. </p>
	      <p>The totally enclosed control box contains a resin sealed circuit control, stainless steel burner, hot surface ignition (HSI) and operational control lights. A regulated balance of air and gas (with inputs from 50,000 to 150,000 BTU/h) are mixed in the stainless steel burner and fanforced into a four inch diameter, 16 gauge aluminized steel combustion tube. Actual ignition of this mixture is achieved through the use of a reliable globar ignitor, easily monitored from the floor through a conveniently placed sight glass. As the radiant emitter tube temperature increases, maximum efficiency is achieved and infra-red rays are emitted. The efficient design of the technologically-advanced Re-Verber-Ray burner ensures the ultimate in heat distribution along the entire length for maximum radiant efficiency. The Re-Verber-Ray engineered reflector design used on the AG1 Series employs adjustable, polished aluminum, parabolic reflectors directing the infra-red rays in your designated heating zones. As a result, just like the sun, animals and objects absorb the infra-red heat energy and reradiate the heat to the surrounding area. </p>

	      <p>For both new construction and retrofitting this means safe, dependable and consistent Re-Verber-Ray infra-red heating which is backed by over three decades of research and development. The operational features include:</p>
	      <ul>
		<li>Exclusively-designed turbulator baffle ensures optimal thermal efficiency.</li>
		<li>Two safety differential pressure switches to monitor air inlet and exhaust.</li>
		<li>Two foot stainless steel flex connector as standard equipment.</li>
		<li>Stainless steel burner for longevity.</li>
		<li>Heaters may be installed unvented, or vented through a sidewall or roof.</li>
		<li>Optional "U" and "L" configurations to meet virtually any design requirements.</li>
		<li>16 gauge titanium alloy aluminized steel, or aluminized steel, combustion chamber with corrosion-resistant highly emissive black coating standard.</li>
		<li>16 gauge aluminized steel radiant tubes with corrosion-resistant highly emissive black coating standard.</li>
	      </ul>
	      <h5>Other Features:</h5>
	      <ul>
		<li>Model lengths of 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 feet.</li>
		<li>Inputs of 50, 60, 75, 100, 125 and 150 BTUh.</li>
		<li>Resin encapsulated solid state ignition system.</li>
		<li>Three foot supply voltage cord and plug that employs liquid-tight connectors.</li>
		<li>One year limited warranty on the controls and a three year warranty on the combustion chamber and radiant tubes.</li>
		<li>Optional outside combustion air allows combustion air and heater controls to be isolated from adverse conditions.</li>
		<li>Approved by the Canadian Standards Association for vented or unvented use.</li>
		<li>The exchanger coupling system utilizes a "slip fit" system, as well as a four inch band clamp for added security and a continuous linear appearance.</li>
		<li> The engineered reflector design includes fully adjustable polished aluminum parabolic reflectors complete with end caps and can be installed at angles from 0 to 45 degrees.</li>
