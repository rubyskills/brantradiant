		<h5>Re-Verber-Ray Infra-Red Heating Systems Designed For Agricultural Applications = Enhanced Overall Animal Performance + Energy Savings Up To 50%</h5>
		<br>

		<p>Re-Verber-Ray AG2 Series two-stage tube-type infra-red heaters offer more options and savings in specific agricultural applications.</p>

		<h5>Overall Design Criteria:</h5>

		<p>For all agricultural applications we recommend that a qualified person (such as an agricultural engineer or factory trained design specialist) complete a detailed environmental analysis to ensure proper heater selection and overall system compatibility. Re-Verber-Ray infra-red heating systems are an excellent method of optimizing the animals environmental needs</p>
		<p>Heater layouts for both new construction, and retrofit, typically include a warm zone, transitioning to a cool zone, thus allowing each animal to find their optimum comfort zone. Heater layouts are custom-tailored to your specific situation and take into consideration: total building heatloss; ventilation heatloss; overall radiant coverage; heat gain from the animals themselves; ventilation inlet location; orientation of the actual heaters and; unique design restrictions in a particular installation that may include clearance to combustibles, feed lines, air inlets and mounting height of the heaters.</p>

		<h5>The Two-Stage Re-Verber-Ray AG2 Series</h5>

		<p>Two-stage technology was introduced to Canada by Brant Radiant Heaters in 1994 and offers more design and performance options to you, the producer.</p>
		<p>The two-stage principle of infra-red heating evolved from research that clearly showed a typical building requires its total designed heating capacity in Canada around 10 percent of the heating season. The Re-Verber-Ray two-stage AG2 Series was specifically developed to more efficiently meet the heating requirements of the other 90 percent of the heating season in agricultural environments.</p>
		<p>Independent test data (available upon request) has compared the fuel efficiency of two-stage versus single stage infra-red heating and conclusively demonstrated that Re-Verber-Ray two stage technology used in the AG2 Series results in a clearly more efficient heating system when compared with standard single-stage.</p>
		Highlights of the conclusions from the technical reports include:
		<ul>
		  <li>A significant reduction in the number of on-off cycles - up to 35 percent - resulting in increased energy savings, improved comfort and extended product life.</li>
		  <li>A minimum of 12 percent energy saving utilizing two-stage technology, when compared with single stage infra-red heating.</li>
		  <li>For really cold Winter days - about ten percent of the heating season - full heat output is readily available with the "high-fire" mode of two-stage technology. Using the "low-fire" mode for 90 percent of the heating season means enhanced overall animal performance.</li>
		  <li>Two-stage technology used in the Re-Verber-Ray AG2 Series results in a cleaner environment.</li>
		  <li>Your agricultural operation can realize energy savings of up to 50 percent when compared with traditional forced air systems.</li>
		</ul>

                <img src="img/AG1-product-literature.gif" />
		
		<p>The Re-Verber-Ray AG2 Series have a wide variety of operational features that lead the industry. For both new construction and retrofitting this means safe, dependable and consistent Re-Verber-Ray infra-red heating which is backed by over three decades of research and development.</p>
		The operational features include:
		<ul>
		  <li>Exclusively-designed turbulator baffle ensures optimal thermal efficiency.</li>
		  <li>Two safety differential pressure switches to monitor air inlet and exhaust.</li>
		  <li>Two foot stainless steel flex connector as standard equipment.</li>
		  <li>Stainless steel burner for longevity.</li>
		  <li>Heaters may be installed unvented, or vented through a sidewall or roof.</li>
		  <li>Optional "U" and "L" configurations to meet virtually any design requirements.</li>
		  <li>16 gauge titanium alloy aluminized steel, or aluminized steel, combustion chamber with corrosion-resistant highly emissive black coating standard.</li>
		  <li>16 gauge aluminized steel radiant tubes with corrosion-resistant highly emissive black coating standard.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>Other Features:</h5>
		<ul>
		  <li>Model lengths of 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 feet.</li>
		  <li>Inputs of 75, 100, 125 and 150 BTUh.</li>
		  <li>Control box includes staging indicator lights for monitoring continuous energy savings.</li>
		  <li>The industry leading Micro 60U-24, a self-diagnostic microprocessor based control that incorporates pre and post purge firing as well a "hard" and "soft" lockout.</li>
		  <li>Supply voltage and control voltage wiring employ liquid-tight connectors.</li>
		  <li>Two-stage flexibility to maximize overall animal performance in specific agricultural applications by utilizing a "calculated input differential" - the difference between the "high-fire" and "low-fire" levels of operation.</li>
