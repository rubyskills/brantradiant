      <h1 id="page-title">AUTO SERVICE</h1>
      <p>Most auto service garages and vehicle maintenance facilities have a large percentage of open door area in relationship to overall square footage.  Cold vehicles being brought into the space make infrared heaters ideal for heating this space economically.</p>
      <p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-313" alt="IMG_0366_1(lofgren)" src="http://staging.detroitradiant.ideosolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_0366_1lofgren.jpg" width="470" height="353" /></p>
      <p>Overhead doors and vehicle lifts must be taken into consideration in the placement of heaters as doors or vehicles raised on the lifts may be damaged by infrared heaters placed in close proximity. The presence of vehicle lifts sometimes forces the placement of heaters down center aisles with reflectors angled toward the bay area. Also, care must be taken to maintain clearances from hose reels, exhaust collection systems, etc.</p>
      <p>Since most auto service garages employ the use of degreasers, parts washers, rust-proofing, etc., the use of low intensity infrared tube heaters with outside combustion air supplied to each heater is recommended. Chemical contaminants need to be ventilated from the space mechanically even if tube heaters with outside air are utilized. Such fumes striking the surface of the hot radiant tube or being heated at floor levels can cause a chemical reaction resulting in offensive odors being present in the space. Most chemical fumes of this type are heavier than air and ventilation of the lower level of the building is recommended.</p>
      <p><strong>Equipment Selection</strong>: Depending on mounting height requirements, a full range of infrared heater models is available for application into auto service centers. Typically, tubes (75,000-150,000 BTU/h) are most commonly applied, but also popular are high intensity DR Series Heaters (30,000-90,000 BTUâ€™s).</p>
      <p>The use of a vacuum system is usually prohibitive due to size and cost constraints. Two-stage modesl, such as the HL3 Series, provide faster heat recoveries as doors are opened and closed. Heaters are thermostatically controlled and very often interlocked with ventilation when unvented high instensity DR Series heaters are installed.</p>
      <p><strong>Installation</strong>: Apply heaters on a perimeter mounted design when applicable. Stack the door areas with extra units, or locate tube burner boxes there to provide extra heat. Take care to avoid violating the published clearances to combustibles with doors in the open position and/or lifts (with cars on them) in the up position. Common applications also utilize tubes located between lift rows (center of the building) or along side walls with reflectors positioned inward. Outside combustion air is highly recommended. Lastly, do not place any heater inside of a paint booth.</p>
