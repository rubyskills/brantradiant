		<p><strong>Installation Considerations</strong></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Proper design</li>
		  <li>Gas supply and pressure</li>
		  <li>Mounting heights</li>
		  <li>Clearance to combustibles</li>
		  <li>Burner box location</li>
		  <li>Chemicals or vapors in the space</li>
		  <li>High moisture/harsh environment</li>
		  <li>Venting lengths and locations</li>
		  <li>Reflector angle</li>
		  <li>Necessary guarding</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Responsibility of the Installer and Users</strong><br />
		  Infrared heaters must be installed by a qualified person or agency per applicable codes and the manufacturer’s Installation, Operation and Service manuals.<br />
		  <strong><em>The qualified installer shall:</em></strong></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Install the heater in accordance with the published minimum clearances to combustibles and other heater specifications.</li>
		  <li>Provide access for servicing.</li>
		  <li>Give a copy of the manufacturer’s Installation, Operation and Service manual to the owner.</li>
		  <li>Ensure there is adequate air circulation around the heater.</li>
		  <li>Ensure the heater is placed in an approved application.</li>
		  <li>Ensure that building materials with a low heat tolerance are protected to prevent degradation.</li>
		  <li>“&#8230;in locations used for storage of combustible materials, signs shall be posted to specify the maximum permissible stacking height to the combustibles.”<br />
		    This is quoted from the National Fuel Gas Code (ANSI Z223.1), and the Standard for Gas-Fired Low-Intensity Infrared Heaters (ANSI Z83.20).</li>
		  <li>ANSI Z83.20 further states “&#8230;and such signs must either be posted adjacent to the heat thermostat or in the absence of such thermostat in a conspicuous location.”</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Specialty Applications: </strong><br />
		  Certain applications may require additional design and installation considerations.<br />
		  Contact the factory or your local representative for assistance when applying infrared heaters in applications such as:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>High altitude sites</li>
		  <li>Residential applications</li>
		  <li>Areas with non-standard gas</li>
		  <li>CNG bus stations/service garages</li>
		  <li>Agricultural applications</li>
		  <li>Outdoor patios</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Do Your Part!</strong><br />
		  Gas-fired infrared heating appliances are a great method to efficiently heat many applications when properly applied and maintained. By actively following the tips listed here, infrared heaters can potentially increase a building’s overall efficiency ratio, reduce the output of greenhouse gases, and increase comfort levels in the building.
