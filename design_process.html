      <p>Regardless of heater type, it is important that the design meets the application requirements in order to achieve the best comfort levels and to maximize efficiencies.</p>
      <p>Choosing the right heating solution is accomplished with knowledge of the facility that is to be heated. It is best to plan thoroughly and design an infrared heating layout that will ensure optimal performance. Improper equipment application can result in undesired results.</p>

      <p><strong>Basic Application Guidelines</strong><br />
	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Conduct A Building Survey</span><br />
	When designing an infrared system, a proper building survey will help to ensure its optimal performance. An accurate heat loss calculation with an emphasis on air changes must be conducted. The strategic location of the burners will allow for added heat in areas where it is most needed. Vent location, air intake, gas supply and operational obstacles must also be considered.</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Discuss Performance Expectations</span><br />
	Understanding your customerâ€™s needs is paramount to the overall satisfaction of the installation. Remember that many people do not fully understand the operating characteristics of an infrared heater and it is important to help educate them. The following questions should be reviewed prior to the installation:</p>
      <ul>
	<ul>
	  <li>What is the overall heating objective (spot heat, freeze control, etc.)?</li>
	  <li>What are the expectations of the infrared system?</li>
	  <li>Is the temperature differential acknowledged?</li>
	  <li>Will the clearances to combustibles always be maintained?</li>
	</ul>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. Review Recommended Mounting Heights</span><br />
	While mounting heights are not mandatory to follow, they are critical in the proper application of the appliance. Mounting heights are one of the most important factors in the selection process as they are directly correlated to the radiant footprint and overall comfort levels.</p>
