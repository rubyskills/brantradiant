              <h1 class="title">Infrared is Efficient and Effective</h1>
              <p>A gas fired infrared heating system emulates the efficiency of the sun. This method of heating allows the source of heat to begin at floor not ceiling level. Once the infrared energy is absorbed by floors, machinery, stock and people, it is re-radiated to warm the surrounding air. This makes it the most efficient and effective heating method for the diverse conditions present in warehouses, storerooms and other immense structures.</p>
