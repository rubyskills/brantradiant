		      <p>The fan is a critical tube heater component and must be kept clean.  When cleaning the fan, be sure to clean each fin on the impeller fan (squirrel cage) to ensure proper air movement. Oil the motor annually using SAE 20 or SAE 30 Motor Oil.</p>
		      <p>A heater that hangs in a dirty or moist operating environment should be covered or removed during the summer months.</p>
		      <p>A dirty reflector will adversely impact the output and performance of an infrared heater. Clean reflectors annually using a wet rag or sponge.  If your aluminum reflector is stained or discolored, try cleaning it with <a href="http://www.drp-co.com/partscenter/product_info.php/products_id/878?osCsid=f3a6b20d97abf204cf74384d7ed993ab" target="_blank">Alumiprep 33 by Henkel Technologies</a>.</p>
		      <p>To avoid blockages in the venting from birds nesting, a screen can be installed on your vent cap with squares spaced 1/4 to 1/2 inches across. If using high pressure air to clean a ceramic heater DO NOT exceed 30 psi or you risk removing the gasket material that lines each ceramic. High pressure air should be applied carefully and from a distance of 3 to 5 feet. DO NOT apply high pressure air to a gas valve or air pressure switch as this will rupture the componentâ€™s internal diaphragm.</p>
		      <p>When checking the combustion chamber noted on the annual inspection checklist, pay particular attention to the integrity of the top portion of the tube nearest the burner (the first 10-feet) as this is where the failure risk is greatest.</p>
