            The Sun is the Best Example
          </h3>
          <p class="description">
            Without question the sun is the best example of an infra-red heat source. The sun transmits heat through space to earth by radiation, releasing heat only when the infra-red rays strike the earth's surface. Like the sun, our natural gas, propane and electric infra-red heaters also produce infra-red rays.

            Compare the Comfort
          </h3>
          <p class="description">
            Traditional hot air heating systems waste energy by blowing warm air downward, which then rises again to the ceiling of a building, where it is wasted. Re-Verber-Ray and Quartz-Ray heaters quietly focus energy efficient infra-red rays to the floor area, thus maintaining a clean, even heat. In drafty applications, such as loading areas, infra-red heating can reduce heat recovery time by supplying a continuous "blanket" of infra-red heat energy to the selected floor area. The absorbed radiant heat energy is less affected by multiple air exchanges that occur in many work environments.

            "Zone Heating" Only Where and When Required
          </h3>
          <p class="description">
            Many indoor locations require "zone heating" - such as work stations near frequently opened loading doors. Many times, only a few people are working in a small area in a large building. Energy efficient Re-Verber-Ray infra-red heaters allows heat to be directed only where and when required.

            What About Energy Savings With Infra-Red Heating?
          </h3>
          <p class="description">
	    Market proven results show energy costs reduced up to 40 percent with fixed input infra-red heaters when compared with forced air heating. Independent testing has documented a minimum 12 percent additional savings through a 35 percent reduction in "on and off cycles" when the Re-Verber-Ray HL Series is compared with "single input" infra-red heating systems.
