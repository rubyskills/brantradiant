      <h5>High Intensity Infrared Luminous Heaters</h5>
      <p>Gas-fired high intensity heaters are direct-fired and pass a gas-air mixture through a porous matrix refractory material which ignites evenly across the surface. This surface is heated to temperatures of 1350°F or above, emitting a large concentration of infrared radiation that may be directed anywhere heat is desired. High intensity heaters typically operate unvented. Proper ventilation is necessary to dissipate combustion gases released into the space.</p>

	  <p><strong>Electric Infrared Heaters<br />
	    </strong>Electric infrared heaters produce heat by running an electric current through a high-resistance element. They are commonly used in areas where gas is impractical or unavailable.</p>

      <h5>Low Intensity Infrared Radiant Tube Heaters</h5>
      <p>Gas-fired infrared heaters are an indirectly fired appliance, and have a radiating surface between the combustion and the intended load. When there is a call for heat, a flame is ignited within an exchanger. The exchanger is then heated to temperatures up to 1350°F, emitting infrared energy. This energy is directed to the floor level via reflectors and is absorbed by people and objects in its path. A heat differential exists along the length of the heat exchanger because more heat is produced in the first half of the tube at the burner/combustion end, than the second half of the tube at the exhaust end. A well designed unit minimizes this temperature differential.</p>
      <p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-233" alt="V3_tube" src="http://staging.detroitradiant.ideosolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/V3_tube.jpg" width="118" height="200" /><strong>Forced Draft Systems (Push)</strong><br />
	- A forced draft system operates under a positive pressure, pushing the products of combustion through the length of the exchanger tubes. This type of infrared heater is easy to service and install because all of the components are housed in one compartment. When compared to other tube heater types, push tube heaters offer a variety of production, installation and operating benefits.</p>
      <p><strong>Draft Induced Systems (Pull)</strong> &#8211; A draft induced tube heater operates under negative pressure pulling the products of combustion through the length of the exchanger tubes. This type of infrared heater offers reliable performance in high-wind applications and sometimes can allow for extended vent runs.</p>
      <p><strong>Multiple Burner Vacuum System</strong> – Multiple burner systems operate under negative pressure pulling the products of combustion through various runs of radiant exchanger tubing via a powerful vacuum exhauster pump. This type of infrared heater is used when minimal building penetrations are required, or if extended vent runs are necessary.</p>
